    <h3>
      Between now and the 2020 political conventions, there will be discussion
      about the qualifications of presidential candidates -- their education,
      age, religion, race, and so on. If your party nominated a generally
      well-qualified person for president who happened to be [characteristic],
      would you vote for that person?
    </h3>
    <p>
      These characteristics included race, religion, age, and other major
      aspects that influence how the voting public views a candidate. This quiz
      will ask you to guess what percent of Americans responded "Yes" to each
      characteristic. Afterwards, you can compare your answers to the poll's
      results. By taking this quiz, you'll walk away with a lot more information
      on America's voting tendencies.
